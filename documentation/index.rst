PVXS client/server for PVA Protocol
===================================

This module provides a library (libpvxs.so or pvxs.dll) and a set of
CLI utilities acting as PVAccess protocol client and/or server.

PVXS is functionally equivilant to the
`pvDataCPP <https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP>`_ and
`pvAccessCPP <https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessCPP>`_ modules,
which it hopes to eventually surplant (Ok, the author hopes).
