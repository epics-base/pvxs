|security| Secure PVAccess
===============

Secure PVAccess (SPVA) enhances the existing PVAccess protocol by integrating :ref:`transport_layer_security` (TLS)
with comprehensive :ref:`certificate_management`, enabling encrypted communication channels and authenticated connections
between EPICS clients and servers (EPICS agents) - see :ref:`authn_and_authz`.

For a glossary of terms see: :ref:`glossary`

Key Features:

- Encrypted communication using ``TLS 1.3``
- Certificate-based authentication
- Comprehensive certificate lifecycle management
- Backward compatibility with existing PVAccess deployments
- Integration with site authentication systems

In SPVA terminology, an `EPICS Agent` refers to any PVAccess network client.

Note: This release requires specific unmerged changes to epics-base.

See :ref:`quick_start` to get started.

.. _transport_layer_security:

Transport Layer Security
------------------------

``SPVA`` uses ``TLS 1.3`` to establish secure connections between EPICS agents. Both client and server
can authenticate their peer using ``X.509`` certificates. Key features of the TLS implementation:

- Mutual authentication when both peers present valid certificates
- Server-only authentication when only the server presents a certificate
- Fallback to ``TCP`` when ``TLS`` is not configured or certificates are invalid
- Certificate status verification during connection establishment

TLS encapsulation of the PVAccess protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In network protocols, encapsulation is used to transport a higher layer protocol over a lower layer protocol, e.g., ``TCP`` over ``IP``.
In the context of TLS, PVAccess messages are encapsulated within ``TLS`` records for secure transport.

Encapsulation involves wrapping the higher-layer protocol's data within the lower-layer protocol's format.
TLS is so named because it wraps all data above the ``Transport Layer`` in an impermeable ``Security`` layer.
For SPVA, this means PVAccess messages are wrapped in TLS records that include headers specifying
content type, protocol version, and length, followed by the encrypted PVAccess data as the payload.

.. image:: pvaencapsulation.png
   :alt: TLS Encapsulation of PVAccess
   :align: center

Note: We use ``TLS version 1.3`` for Secure PVAccess. This version deprecates support for connection renegotiation which is a security risk. So any
connections that are established using Secure PVAccess will not be renegotiated but will be closed if a certificate is revoked or needs to be renewed

.. _environment_variables:

Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following environment variables control SPVA behavior:

.. note::

   There is an implied hierarchy to the applicability of the environment variables such that
   the PVAS version supersedes a PVA version.
   So, if an EPICS server agent wants to specify its keychain file location it can simply
   provide the ``EPICS_PVA_TLS_KEYCHAIN`` environment variable as long as
   ``EPICS_PVAS_TLS_KEYCHAIN`` is not configured.

.. _configuration:

API Configuration Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are new configuration options now available
in both the `pvxs::server::Config` and `pvxs::client::Config` classes,
via their public base `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon` class:

- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::expiration_behaviour` - Set certificate expiration behavior
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_keychain_file` - Set keychain file path
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_keychain_pwd` - Set keychain file password
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_client_cert_required` - Control client certificate requirements
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_disable_stapling` - Disable certificate status stapling
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_disable_status_check` - Disable certificate status checking
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_disabled` - Disable TLS
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_port` - Set TLS port number
- `pvxs::impl::ConfigCommon::tls_throw_if_cant_verify` - Control verification failure behavior

Here are server-specific configuration options:

- `pvxs::server::Config::tls_stop_if_no_cert` - Stop server if certificate unavailable
- `pvxs::server::Config::tls_throw_if_no_cert` - Throw exception if certificate unavailable


API Additions for Secure PVAccess
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runtime Reconfiguration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows runtime reconfiguration of a TLS connection.  It does this by dropping all TLS connections and
then re-initialising them using the given configuration.  This means checking if the certificates
and keys exist, loading and verifying them, checking for status and status of peers, etc.

`pvxs::client::Context::reconfigure` and `pvxs::server::Server::reconfigure` allow runtime TLS configuration updates:

.. code-block:: c++

    // Initial client setup with certificate
    auto cli_conf(serv.clientConfig());
    cli_conf.tls_keychain_file = "client1.p12";
    auto cli(cli_conf.build());

    // Later reconfiguration with new certificate
    cli_conf = cli.config();
    cli_conf.tls_keychain_file = "client2.p12";
    cli_conf.tls_keychain_pwd = "pwd";
    cli.reconfigure(cli_conf);

Wildcard PV Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This addition is based on the Wildcard PV support included in epics-base since version 3.  It
extends this support to pvxs allowing PVs to be specified as wildcard patterns.  We use this
to provide individualised PVs for each certificate's status management.

`pvxs::server::SharedWildcardPV` support for pattern-matched PV names:

.. code-block:: c++

    // Define a server that responds to any SEARCH request with WILDCARD:PV:<4-characters>:<any-string>
    // It will extract the 4-character part of the PV name as the `id` and
    // the last string as the `name`

    SharedWildcardPV wildcard_pv(SharedWildcardPV::buildMailbox());
    wildcard_pv.onFirstConnect([](SharedWildcardPV &pv, const std::string &pv_name,
                                const std::list<std::string> &parameters) {
        // Extract id and name from parameters
        auto it = parameters.begin();
        const std::string &id = *it;
        const std::string &name = *++it;

        // Process and post value
        if (pv.isOpen(pv_name)) {
            pv.post(pv_name, value);
        } else {
            pv.open(pv_name, value);
        }
    });
    wildcard_pv.onLastDisconnect([](SharedWildcardPV &pv, const std::string &pv_name,
                                const std::list<std::string> &parameters) {
        pv.close(pv_name);
    });

    // Add wildcard PV to server
    serv.addPV("WILDCARD:PV:????:*", wildcard_pv);

.. _protocol_operation:

Protocol Operation
------------------

.. _connection_establishment:

Connection Establishment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connections are established using TLS if at least the server side is configured for TLS.

Prior to the TLS handshake:

- Certificates are loaded and validated
- CA trust is verified all the way down the chain
- Both sides subscribe to certificate status where configured for their own certificate and all those in the chain
- All certificate statues are cached

During the TLS handshake:

- Certificates are exchanged
- Servers staple cached certificate status in handshake
- Both sides validate and verify their peer certificate against trusted root certificates

After the TLS handshake:

- Both sides subscribe to peer certificate status where configured
- Clients may use OCSP stapled status immediately before waiting for status monitoring results

.. _state_machines:

State Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Server TLS Context State Machine:*

The server transitions based on:

- Certificate validity
- CA trust status
- Certificate status monitoring results
- :ref:`configuration` options (e.g., stop_if_no_cert)

States:

- ``Init``: Initial state, loads and validates certificates
- ``TcpReady``: Responds to TCP protocol requests when certificates are valid
- ``TlsReady``: Responds to both TCP and TLS protocol requests

*Client TLS Context State Machine:*

Similar to server state machine but

- Never exits on TLS configuration issues
- Moves to ``DEGRADED`` state and continues with TCP protocol if needed

Search Handler State Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Server Search Handler:*

States:

- ``DegradedMode``: Responds only to TCP protocol requests
- ``TcpReady``: Responds only to TCP protocol requests, ignores TLS
- ``TlsReady``: Responds to both TCP and TLS protocol requests

*Client Search Handler:*

- Similar to server but from client perspective
- Executes ``TLS_CONNECTOR`` on successful TLS handshake
- Falls back to ``TCP_CONNECTOR`` otherwise

.. _connection_state_machine:

Connection State Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Server Connection:*

- Manages TLS handshake and certificate validation
- Monitors peer certificate status
- Continues normal operation only after successful validation

.. _tls_handshake:

TLS Handshake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following diagram shows the simplified TLS handshake sequence between server and client:

.. image:: spvaseqdiag.png
   :alt: SPVA Sequence Diagram
   :align: center

1. Each agent uses an ``X.509`` certificate for peer authentication
2. During handshake:

   - Certificates are exchanged
   - Both sides verify peer certificates against trusted root certificates
   - Multiple certificates may be verified in the chain to trusted CA
   - Local verification checks signature, expiration, and usage flags

3. SPVA certificates may include status monitoring extension requiring:

   - Subscription to certificate status from issuing Certificate Authority's service (:ref:`pvacms`)
   - Receipt of GOOD status before trust

4. Agents subscribe to:

   - Peer's certificate status
   - Own certificate status and certificate chain

5. Servers cache and staple certificate status in handshake

.. _online_certificate_status_protocol_OCSP:

OCSP and Status Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _ocsp_stapling:

OCSP Stapling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OCSP Stapling optimizes certificate status verification during TLS handshake:

.. figure:: images/ocsp_stapling.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center
    :name: ocsp-stapling

- Enabled by default with status monitoring extension
- Disable using EPICS_PVAS_TLS_OPTIONS="disable_stapling"

.. _status_verification:

Status Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Certificate Status recieved from the PVACMS for a certificate returns a ``GOOD`` status
    if, and only if, the certificate status is good and so is that of its certificate authority certificate
    chain all the way back to the root certificate.  In this way agents need monitor
    only their own entity certificate and that of their peer.

Certificate status verification occurs at several points:

1. Initial Connection

   - Certificates are verified during TLS handshake
   - Both peers verify against a trusted root certificates that they have loaded from their own keychain file
   - Basic checks include:

     - Signature validation
     - Expiration dates
     - Usage flags

2. Runtime Monitoring

   - EPICS agents subscribe to:

     - Their own certificate status
     - Peer entity certificate status

3. Status Response Handling

   - If status not received:

     - Search requests are ignored
     - Client retries later

   - If status not GOOD:

     - Server offers only TCP protocol
     - Client fails connection validation

   - If status GOOD:

     - Server offers both TCP and TLS
     - Connection proceeds normally

4. Optimization

   - Servers cache status for stapling
   - Clients can use stapled status
   - Reduces initial :ref:`pvacms` requests

.. _status_caching:

Status Caching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Agents subscribe to peer certificate
- Status transitions trigger connection status re-evaluation
- Cached status used within validity period to reduce :ref:`pvacms` requests
- Servers staple cached status in handshake
- Clients may skip initial :ref:`pvacms` request using stapled status

Beacons
^^^^^^^

PVAccess Beacon Messages have not been upgraded to TLS support. Important considerations:

1. Historical Use:
   - Previously used to trigger resend of unanswered Search Messages
   - This practice is now discouraged
   - Other methods should be used to determine server status

2. Current Behavior:
   - Servers broadcast on any configured port
   - Clients should not use ports directly
   - Use only as server availability indicator

3. Security Implications:
   - Beacons remain unencrypted
   - Do not contain sensitive information
   - Cannot be used for secure discovery

.. _protocol_debugging:

Protocol Debugging
------------------

TLS Packet Inspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For detailed TLS traffic analysis:

1. Enable key logging at build time:

   - Set PVXS_ENABLE_SSLKEYLOGFILE during compilation

2. Configure runtime logging:

.. code-block:: shell

    export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/sslkeylog.log

3. Configure Wireshark:

   - Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS
   - Set "(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename" to match SSLKEYLOGFILE path
   - TLS traffic will now be decrypted in Wireshark

Debug Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable detailed PVXS debug logging:

1. Environment variable method:

.. code-block:: shell

    export PVXS_LOG="pvxs.stapling*=DEBUG"

New Debug Categories:

- ``pvxs.certs.auth``          - Authenticators
- ``pvxs.auth.cfg``            - Authn configuration
- ``pvxs.auth.cms``            - CMS
- ``pvxs.auth.jwt``            - JWT Authenticator
- ``pvxs.auth.krb``            - Kerberos Authenticator
- ``pvxs.auth.mon``            - Certificate Status Monitoring
- ``pvxs.auth.stat``           - Certificate Status
- ``pvxs.auth.std``            - Standard Authenticator
- ``pvxs.auth.tool``           - Certificate Management Tools (``pvacert``)
- ``pvxs.certs.status``        - Certificate Status Management
- ``pvxs.ossl.init``           - TLS initialization
- ``pvxs.ossl.io``             - TLS I/O
- ``pvxs.stapling``            - OCSP stapling

.. _network_deployment:

Network Deployment
------------------

Deployment Patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Standard Network Deployment

   - Agents run on networked hosts with local storage
   - Certificates stored in local protected directories
   - Standard TLS configuration applies

2. Diskless Network Deployment

   - Agents run on hosts without local storage
   - Certificates stored on network-mounted storage
   - Special considerations for certificate protection

3. Hybrid Deployment

   - Mix of standard and diskless nodes
   - Common trust anchor required
   - Consistent :ref:`certificate_management` across node types

Certificate Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standard Nodes:

- ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` standard is used by default to locate certificates for clients and server

  - default if not set is ``~/.config``
  - we append ``/pva/1.3/`` to make the full path default to ``~/.config/pva/1.3/``
  - client certificates are stored in ``client.p12`` by default
  - server certificates are stored in ``server.p12`` by default

- Store certificates in local protected directory

  - the files are protected with ``400`` so that only the owner can read

- Automatic reconfiguration on certificate updates

Diskless Nodes:

- Use network-mounted storage (NFS, SMB/CIFS, AFP)
- Protected certificate storage location
- Optional password protection via diskless server

Trust Establishment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Root Certificate Distribution:

   - Administrators must distribute PKCS#12 files containing the CA Root certificate to all clients
   - These files must be stored at the location pointed to by EPICS_PVA_TLS_KEYCHAIN or equivalent
   - These files are replaced with any new certificates that are generated for the user but
     the root certificate authority certificate is preserved
   - Use of publicly signed root certificates is not supported at present
   - The only exception is when clients use any Authenticator to generate certificates.
     In this case the root certificate authority certificate is delivered with the certificate.  Users
     must verify that the issuer of the certificate matches the Root CA they are expecting.
   - Consistent across all deployment types

2. Certificate Authority:

   - :ref:`pvacms` serves as site CA
   - Common trust anchor for all nodes
   - Handles certificate lifecycle management
