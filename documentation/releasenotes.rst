1.3.1 (Dec 2023)
----------------

* Install pvxsIoc.dbd with the correct name in python build.
* No change to Makefile build.

1.3.0 (Dec 2023)
----------------

* Set TCP_NODELAY on client and server sockets.
* Disambiguate Size from Selector when decoding messages.
* QSRV
   * :ref:`qsrv2` now considered "feature complete".
   * Avoid sending 0 precision w/ integer value.
   * Add :ref:`pvalink`.

----------------

* data: Relax when assigning struct[] or union[] of similar types.
* client: avoid assert() with invalid forced server name.
* client: propagate exception during early op. setup.
* client: GET yield complete updates after first.
* server: Ensure that variables bound into operation callback ``std::function<>`` are
  released promptly when that operation is ended.
* server: relax post() after finish().  Return false instead of throwing ``std::logic_error``.
* ioc: ensure db_cancel_event() before ~MonitorControlOp
   * Workaround for [db_cancel_event()](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/issues/423) bug.

* Add wrappers for some libevent socket manipulations as :ref:`expertapi`.
* Improve diff output of `testStrEq`.
* msvc build compat.  ``/wd*`` compiler flags sometimes interpreted as paths.

1.1.0 (Nov 2022)
----------------

* Client Subscription yields "complete" Value to user code.
  Unchanged fields will appear with the values most recently received,
  kept in an internal cache.  As a consequence, array and union fields
  will always be shared with this case, and can never be safety modified.
* Change Server monitor watermark meaning from edge to level trigger.
* `pvxs::SigInt` executes callback on worker thread instead of signal context.
* Added API

  * `pvxs::client::Subscription::stats` and `pvxs::server::MonitorControlOp::stats`

  * `pvxs::TypeDef::as()` overload to change Struct -> StructA.
  * `pvxs::Value::clear()`

1.0.1 (Oct 2022)

* Fix locking of client monitor during pop()
* Calculate buffer sizes in terms of OS socket buffer limit
* Fix low water mark calculation
* Fix Timer ownership (expert API)
* Avoid ``assert()`` when client asked to search for PV names longer than 1400 bytes.

1.0.0 (Sept 2022)
-----------------

* Add `pvxs::client::ConnectBuilder::server`
* Add hold-off timer when reconnecting to a specific server.
* Fix missing closing quote when printing a ``String`` in tree format.

0.3.1 (June 2022)
-----------------

* Fix ifaddrs::ifa_addr can be NULL
* Limit beacon tracking by size as well as time

0.3.0 (May 2022)
----------------

* Fix protocol **incompatibility** with Big Endian servers.
* Add support for IPv4 multicast and IPv6 uni/multicast for UDP.  And IPv6 unicast for TCP.
  See :ref:`addrspec` for entries which may now appear in **EPICS_PVA*_ADDR_LIST**.
* PVXS now attempts to fanout unicast searches through the loopback interface, and
  to handle ``CMD_ORIGIN_TAG`` messages (aka. the local multicast hack).
* Add `pvxs::client::Context::discover` to enumerate and track PVA Servers.
* ``pvxlist`` add "continuous" mode.  (eg. ``pvxlist -v -w 0``)
  To immediately Discover new servers, then continue listening for Beacons to detect
  as server go up and down (like ``casw``).
  Also, to be gentler on your network, add ``-P`` to skip initial Discovery ping,
  and only listen for Beacons.

0.2.2 (Jan 2022)
----------------

* No functional change to libraries.
* Updates to python packaging.

0.2.1 (Oct 2021)
----------------

* Bug fixes

 * Fix `pvxsmonitor` hang when interrupted (Ctrl+c).
 * Fix `pvxs::client::Subscription::shared_from_this()` leaking internal reference.
 * Fix SharedPV potential race conditions involving "current" Value.

* Changes

 * Ignore beacons with protocol field other than "tcp".  Forward compatibility.
 * Limit packet hex dumps to 64 bytes.
 * ``testStrMatch()`` now specified POSIX regular expression syntax.

   Previously produced a non-nonsensical empty request.

* Additions

 * Add `pvxs::client::Context::fromEnv()`.

0.2.0 (July 2021)
-----------------

* Bug fixes

 * Resolve ambiguity between Value::as(T&) and Value::as(FN&&) causing issue with GCC 4.8.
 * Fix encoding of (Sub)Struct w/ valid set.
 * Fix locking issue with client tracking of server beacons.
 * Fix binding to specific interface addresses.

* Changes

 * To simplify usage in situations with complex threading, many client methods avoid unnecessary
   synchronization with the client worker thread.
   Cancellation still synchronizes by default, but this may now be controlled with
   the new syncCancel() Builder methods.  cf. `pvxs::client::detail::CommonBuilder::syncCancel()`.
 * Client Op Builder server() method now implemented.
 * Client channel cache now periodically prunes unused Channels automatically.

* Additions

 * Add server ignore address list.  cf. `pvxs::server::Config::ignoreAddrs`.  Configured from $EPICS_PVAS_IGNORE_ADDR_LIST.
 * Allow TCP timeout to be configured.
 * Add `pvxs::client::Context::connect()` to force Channel creation and retention.
 * Add `pvxs::client::Subscription::shared_from_this()` which can be used with eg. the new `pvxs::MPMCFIFO` to create a work queue.

0.1.4 (APR 2021)
----------------

* Bug Fixes

 * Fix potential locking issue monitor queue
 * Fix potential locking issue in Shared PV with concurrent open()/close() vs. post()

* Additions

 * Add `pvxs::nt::TimeStamp` and `pvxs::nt::Alarm`.

0.1.3 (FEB 2021)
----------------

* Bug Fixes

 * Fix regression from 0.1.2 causing possible crash on targets defining SO_RXQ_OVFL (eg. Linux).

0.1.2 (FEB 2021)
----------------

* Bug Fixes

 * Fix TCP connection "stall" (incorrect deferred read).

* Changes

 * Add `testThrowsMatch` and `testStrMatch` to *pvxs/unitttest.h*
