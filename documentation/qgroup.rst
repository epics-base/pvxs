QSRV Groups
###########

By default no Group PVs are defined.

A Group PV is a mapping of values stored in one or more database records
and made visible through a PVA structure.

A Group is defined using a JSON syntax.
Groups are defined with respect to a *Group Name*, which is also the PV name used when accessing the group.
Unlike records, the "field" of a group have a different meaning than the fields of a record.
Group field names are *not* part of the PV name.

A group definition may be split among several records, or included in separate JSON file(s).
For example of a group including two records is: ::

    record(ai, "rec:X") {
        info(Q:group, {
            "grp:name": {
                "X": {+channel:"VAL"}
            }
        })
    }
    record(ai, "rec:Y") {
        info(Q:group, {
            "grp:name": {
                "Y": {+channel:"VAL"} # .VAL in enclosing record()
            }
        })
    }

Or equivalently with separate .db file and .json files.
Use ``dbLoadGroup()`` to load .json files. ::

    # Store in some .db
    record(ai, "rec:X") {}
    record(ai, "rec:Y") {}
    # Store in some .json
    {
        "grp:name": {
            "X": {+channel:"rec:X.VAL"}, # full PV name
            "Y": {+channel:"rec:Y.VAL"}
        }
    }

This group, named ``grp:name``, has two group fields ``X`` and ``Y``. ::

    $ pvget grp:name
    grp:name
    structure
        epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0 X
            double value 0
            alarm_t alarm INVALID DRIVER UDF
            time_t timeStamp <undefined> 0
    ...
        epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0 Y
            double value 0
            alarm_t alarm INVALID DRIVER UDF
            time_t timeStamp <undefined> 0
    ...

So ``pvget grp:name`` is compatible to ``pvget rec:X rec:Y`` with the added
benefit that with the former, values from the two records are read atomically on the server,
and delivered together.

.. _groupjson:

JSON Reference
==============

A Group `JSON schema <qsrv2-schema-0.json>`_ definition file is available.
Keys beginning appear in contexts where a name may be either a data field name,
or a special key.

.. code-block::

    record(...) {
        info(Q:group, {
            "<group_name>":{
                +id:"some/NT:1.0",  # top level ID
                +atomic:true,
                "<field.name>":{
                    +type:"scalar",
                    +channel:"VAL",
                    +id:"another/NT:1.0",
                    +trigger:"*",
                    +putorder:0,
                },
                # special case adds time/alarm meta-data fields
                # at top level
                "": {+type:"meta", +channel:"VAL"}
            }
        })
    }

Mapping ``+type``:

- ``scalar`` (default) places an NTScalar or NTScalarArray as a sub-structure.  (see :ref:`ntscalar`)
- ``plain`` ignores all meta-data and places only the "value" as a field.
            The field placed will have the type of the ``value`` field of the equivalent NTScalar/NTScalarArray as a field.
- ``any`` places a variant union into which the "value" is stored.
- ``meta`` places only the "alarm" and "timeStamp" fields of ``scalar``.
- ``structure`` places only the associated ``+id``.  Has no ``+channel``.
- ``proc`` places no fields.  The associated ``+channel`` is processed on PUT.
  "proc" mappings will almost always set ``+putorder`` to control the relative
  ordering of record processing.


Mapping ``+channel``:

Most mapping ``+type`` require a ``+channel``.
The most common record field to map is ``+channel: "VAL"``.
When included in an ``info(Q:group, ...``, the ``+channel`` must only name a field of the enclosing record.
(eg. ``+channel:"VAL"``)
When in a separate JSON file, ``+channel`` must be a full PV name, beginning with a record or alias name.
(eg. ``+channel:"record:name.VAL"``)

Mapping ``+trigger``:

Triggers define when and which **changes to the constituent field are translated into a subscription update** to the group.
``+trigger`` may be set to:

- ``""`` (default) means that changes to the field do not cause a subscription update.  (see note below)
- ``"*"`` causes a subscription update containing the most recent values/meta-data of all group fields.
- A comma separated list of field names causes an update with the most recent values of only the listed group fields.
  eg. ``+trigger: "value.A, value.B"``.

For a new group definition, including records from one or more record processing chains,
the last record in that chain should have a ``+trigger`` mapping listing the group fields
updated by records in that chain.

In the common case where a group is mapped to records in only one processing chain,
then the last mapped record in that chain should have ``+trigger: "*"``.

.. note:: As a special case.  A group with no ``+trigger`` mappings at all will function as if every mapping
          includes a ``+trigger`` mapping for itself.
          This is done so that such a situation does not cause confusion be posting no monitor updates at all.
          However, this situation will almost never give desired behaviour as changes to records which
          could otherwise be atomic will be split into multiple subscription updates.

Mapping ``+putorder``:

``+putorder`` must be set for a field to be writable through a group PV.
When more than one mapping has an order defined, the numeric value is used to define
the order in which the associated records are processed (in increasing order).

Additionally, the values of ``+putorder`` also control the order of fields in the group PV definition.
This control is necessary only in limited cases, such as the ``NTTable`` specification,
where the iteration order of fields must match the order of the ``labels`` array.

Understanding Groups
====================

NTTable Group Example
---------------------

One motivating use case for groups involves moving tabular data, encoded as "NTTable".
The overall goal of the ``TST:Tbl`` group PV is to take what would be a series of
discrete, non-atomic, network operations ::

    caput -a TST:A X 1 2 3
    caput -a TST:B X 5 6 7
    caput TST:Save.PROC 1

can instead be a single, atomic, network operation ::

    pvput TST:Tbl value.A='[1,2,3]' value.B='[5,6,7]'

A subscriber sees: ::

    pvmonitor TST:Tbl
    TST:Tbl <undefined>               INVALID DRIVER UDF
    "Label A" "Label B"
    TST:Tbl 2023-08-30 09:55:19.999
    "Label A" "Label B"
            1         5
            2         6
            3         7

This effect is achieved by mapping a table of two columns ("A" and "B") onto two ``aao`` records.
With a third record to take some action once both are updated.

The following is meant to illustrate the mapping between the individual records,
and the fields of the group PV ``TST:Tbl``.

On the left hand side are the contents of a file ``test.db``,
and on the right the output of ``pvget TST:Tbl``.

Here the ``TST:Labels_`` record contributes two mappings to the ``TST:Tbl`` Group.
(a record might contribute mappings to more than one group)

This ``+id`` mapping contributes only the static type label string.
it could be attached to any of the four records, and is arbitrarily placed with this one.

Necessarily, the ``label`` mappings provides the column labels of the "NTTable" definition.
So the record ``TST:Labels_`` field ``VAL`` is mapped into ``TST:Tbl`` as ``labels``.
With ``+type: "plain"``, this appears as a string array ("string[]").

.. image:: _image/nt_table2.svg

The ``TST:A`` record contributes only a ``value.A`` field.
With ``+type: "plain"``, this appears as a string array ("double[]").

The ``value.A`` mapping also sets ``+putorder: 0``, which is necessary to allow this group member
field to be changed through a PUT to the Group PV.
The numeric value controls the order in which records effected by a PUT are processed.
Processing occurs in order of increasing ``+putorder``.

.. image:: _image/nt_table3.svg

The ``TST:B`` record contributes both a ``value.B`` field in the same manner as the A field/column.

Additionally, it contributes a special ``""`` field with ``+type: "meta"``.
This exposes the ``TST:B.VAL`` timestamp and alarm meta-data as the sub-structure
fields ``alarm`` and ``timeStamp``.

.. image:: _image/nt_table4.svg

The final record ``TST:Save`` does not contribute any data fields.
Instead it contributes a special ``+type: "proc"`` mapping.
Also, it contributes a ``+trigger`` mapping so that processing this record will
trigger a subscription/monitor update to all (changed) fields.

Note, the field name ``_save`` only needs to be locally unique within the group,
but is otherwise ignored.
